# Guide to Types

## Generics

There are a lot of generics so I put together a list to keep track of them:

```
A/B - Used when merging two types
A   - "Arguments"
C   - "Command"
D   - "Description"
I   - "Input"
K   - "Key"
L   - "LongFlag"
N   - "Command Name"
O   - "Options"
P   - "Parameter"
R   - "Result/Return Type"
Q   - "Required"
S   - "Sub Commands"
S*  - A type of a subcommand, ex: SN = "SubCommand Name"
T   - Any generic type
V   - "Value"
*2  - New version of a type
```

(I would fully spell these out, but then the code becomes much more verbose and it becomes confusing as to what is a generic and what is a type.)
